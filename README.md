# Talk About - IceBreaker
## Problems being solved ðŸ‘‹
Many people spend a lot of their initial meeting time just asking alot of questions that may or may not be productive. This tool gives you something to break the ice and talk about during the meeting so nothing that is important is missed.

Can be use for dating, business, or just meeting new people.

This project is also a simple proof of concept on an alternative way people might be able to connect with each other. E.g. not the boring LinkedIn profile style. It also allows a user to naturally specify in natural language and freely talk about themselves.

## How to use

2 hardcoded users with user id 123456 and 654321 is being used. Try I like basketball for user 123456 and I like to read for user 654321.

## Future improvements

At it's full implementation, ideally the user would have received a 6 digit number of another who have used the system and entered their hobbies and skills.

Skills and hobbies are just the beginning. Modularly this can include, previous employments, skillsets, specific deep dives such as music you like to listen to etc. Basicall the user should be able to specify information areas that they would like to disclose.
